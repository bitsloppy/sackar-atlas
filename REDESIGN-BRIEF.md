## What this project is

**Sackar Atlas** is an online reference book — a human-verified, machine-readable corpus of primary source documents about LGBTIQ hate crime deaths in NSW. It makes the NSW Special Commission of Inquiry into LGBTIQ Hate Crimes (Sackar J, 2023) and its surrounding record navigable for researchers, journalists, community, and historians.

It documents 30+ deaths — the people, places, institutions, and failures — and makes the connections between them visible in a way a PDF cannot. It is a journalism and research project by Anna Roberts, built on public records (SCOI, Hansard, coronials, Trove, Parrabell). It is not a community heritage project; it is a cartographer's project.

## Current state of the rebuild

### What's done ✅

- Fresh Astro minimal scaffold at `site/` (Astro 7.1.3)
- Web Awesome `^3.10.0` installed
- `src/layouts/Layout.astro` created with correct WA CSS wiring
- Test page confirmed working (styled button renders)
- Baseline committed

### What still exists for reference

- **`site-v1/`** — the full old site with all pages, components, and styles. Use this as a reference for logic and content, not for CSS
- **`git tag v0.1-archive`** — the old site as a git tag, recoverable any time
- **`data/`** — all content data (flat, outside `site/`). This is the source of truth for all cases, locations, events, people, etc.

---

## Technical setup (already done — don't redo)

**WA CSS imports** in `src/layouts/Layout.astro` frontmatter:
```js
import '@awesome.me/webawesome/dist/styles/layers.css';
import '@awesome.me/webawesome/dist/styles/themes/default.css';
```
- `layers.css` first, always
- `themes/default.css` for design tokens
- **Never import `webawesome.css`** — it bundles `native.css` which fights custom styles

**HTML class setup:**
```html
<html lang="en" class="wa-theme-default wa-palette-default wa-light">
```

**Component imports** go in the `<script>` block of the layout (or page file):
```js
import '@awesome.me/webawesome/dist/components/button/button.js';
```
Import only what's used — WA is tree-shaken.

## Data collections

All data lives in `~/code/sackar-atlas/data/` (flat structure). The Astro content config will need to point here from `site/`.

| Collection | Path | Count |
|---|---|---|
| Cases | `data/cases/` | 11 files (10 published, 1 held, 1 excluded) |
| Locations | `data/locations/` | 27 files |
| Events | `data/events/` | 6 files |
| People | `data/people/` | ~57 files |
| Sources | `data/sources/`, `data/source-collections/` | several |
| Recommendations | `data/recommendations/` | stub |
| Testimonies | `data/testimonies/` | 3 |

The old content config is at `site-v1/src/content/config.ts` — copy and adapt it. The glob paths need to point at `../../data/` from `site/src/`.

**Important:** `paul-rath.md` is `published: false` — do not show on public listing. `david-lloyd-williams.md` is excluded (no LGBTIQ connection).

## Pages to build

### Already existed in v1 — rebuild with WA

| Page | Route | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Home | `/` | Hero, about text, nav cards to each section, source note |
| Cases index | `/cases/` | List of published cases as cards |
| Case detail | `/cases/[slug]/` | Full case record — the most complex page |
| Locations index | `/locations/` | List of locations as cards |
| Location detail | `/locations/[slug]/` | Location record with related cases |
| Locations by region | `/locations/region/[region]/` | Filter by region |
| Events index | `/events/` | List of events |
| Event detail | `/events/[slug]/` | Event record |
| People index | `/people/` | List of people |
| Person detail | `/people/[slug]/` | Person record |
| Map | `/map/` | Leaflet map (this is custom, not a WA component) |

### New pages — added 2026-08-09

These three pages are required for the project's journalistic credibility. Build them as part of the initial launch, not as an afterthought. See full content briefs in `docs/site-pages-about.md`.

| Page | Route | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| About the data | `/about/` | What the corpus is; how sources are prepared; how to use the data; audience: researchers, journalists, community |
| AI use policy | `/about/ai/` | Project-level statement on how AI tools were used and what human oversight applies |
| Corrections | `/corrections/` | How to submit a correction; what happens next; displayed corrections register (initially empty) |

### Key components from v1 to rebuild

| Old component | What it does | WA equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| `SectionCard.astro` | Expandable accordion section | `<wa-details>` |
| `FindingBox.astro` | SCOI finding highlighted block | `<wa-callout>` |
| `BadgeTag.astro` | Status/category badge | `<wa-tag>` or `<wa-badge>` |
| Hand-rolled nav cards (home) | Grid of section links | `<wa-card>` in a `wa-grid` |
| Custom tab group (related content) | Tabs for related cases/locations/people/events | `<wa-tab-group>` + `<wa-tab>` + `<wa-tab-panel>` |
| Stub warning | Yellow warning for incomplete records | `<wa-callout variant="warning">` |
| Dividers | Horizontal rules | `<wa-divider>` |

## Design direction

The old site had hand-rolled CSS that accumulated over time. The goal of this rebuild is to let WA's design system do the heavy lifting — tokens for colour, spacing, typography; WA components for UI patterns; custom CSS only where genuinely needed.

**Key aesthetic decisions to make** (in order):
1. **Brand colour** — add a single class to `<html>` (e.g. `wa-brand-blue`, `wa-brand-teal`) to re-brand the whole UI. The old nav was NSW Aboriginal billabong blue (`#00405E`) — worth keeping or adapting.
2. **Theme** — `wa-theme-default` is the starting point. Free themes available.
3. **Typography** — old site used Outfit (UI) + Special Elite (display). Decide whether to keep or go with WA's built-in type scale.
4. **Content-type colours** — old site used red for cases, teal for locations, purple for people, orange for events. Can be layered on top of WA tokens with targeted CSS.

## WA workflow rules (read before writing any WA code)

WA ships machine-readable docs in the npm package. **Always read the relevant skill file before writing component code.**

**Skill paths** (from `site/`):
- `node_modules/@awesome.me/webawesome/dist/skills/webawesome/SKILL.md` — component reference overview
- `node_modules/@awesome.me/webawesome/dist/skills/webawesome/references/choosing-components.md` — decision tree
- `node_modules/@awesome.me/webawesome/dist/skills/webawesome/references/components/[name].md` — specific component API
- `node_modules/@awesome.me/webawesome/dist/skills/webawesome-design/SKILL.md` — design/layout overview
- `node_modules/@awesome.me/webawesome/dist/skills/webawesome-design/references/getting-started.md` — default skeleton
- `node_modules/@awesome.me/webawesome/dist/skills/webawesome-design/references/composition.md` — spacing, type, surfaces

**Rules:**
1. Full page shell → use `<wa-page>`. Sections → use `wa-stack`, `wa-cluster`, `wa-grid`, `wa-split`, `wa-flank`, `wa-frame`
2. Pick components from user intent — read `choosing-components.md` when unsure
3. WA design system first; custom CSS only when WA can't do it
4. Pro-only (don't use): `wa-combobox`, `wa-file-input`, `wa-toast`, all charts, video
5. Import only components that are used

---

## Suggested build order

1. **Content config** — port `site-v1/src/content/config.ts` into `site/src/content/config.ts`, fix glob paths to point at `../../data/`
2. **Layout shell** — expand `Layout.astro` with `<wa-page>` (nav, header, footer, Country acknowledgement)
3. **Home page** — hero + about text + nav cards using `<wa-card>` in `wa-grid`
4. **Cases index** — list of published cases as `<wa-card>` grid
5. **Case detail** — the big one; rich record with `<wa-details>` accordions, `<wa-callout>` findings, `<wa-tab-group>` for related content
6. **Locations, Events, People** — simpler; follow same pattern as cases
7. **Map** — Leaflet, largely custom; port from `site-v1/src/pages/map.astro`
8. **Styling pass** — brand colour, typography, content-type colours
